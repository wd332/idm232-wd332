Leaving any browned bits (or fond) in the pan, transfer to a cutting board and let rest for at least 5 minutes.*\nWhile the steaks rest, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pan of reserved fond; heat on medium-high until hot. Add the quartered mushrooms in an even layer. Cook, without stirring, 3 to 4 minutes, or until lightly browned and slightly softened. Add the sliced shallot and chopped ginger; season with salt and pepper.
