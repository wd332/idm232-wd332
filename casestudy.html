            <h1>Hell's Paradise Case Study</h1>
            <h2>The Overview</h2>
            <p>Hell's Paradise is a recipe website for people looking for simple, easy to browse recipes when they are
                craving something new. Through ideating, designing, and finally development, I created a fully
                functioning website that pulls in data from the database for users to browse. Through this project, I
                learned how to manage a database and execute things in PHP and mySQL.</p>

            <h2>Context & Challenge</h2>
            <p>In this 10-week solo project, I built a fully functional website utilizing PHP and MySQL to create a
                database-driven recipe website. I would be handling multiple types of recipe information (title,
                ingredients, steps, and images) input into the database and have it returned based on user searches and
                filters.</p>
            <hr>
            <h2>Process & Insight</h2>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>This is a recipe website for home cooks or individuals looking for simple, organized, and easy to browse
                recipes. When they are craving for something specific or new, they want quick searching, filtering by
                cuisine, and viewing step-by-step instructions.</p>
            <h3>Design Sketches</h3>
            <p>Features Required:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>home page</li>
                <li>filter results</li>
                <li>no results found</li>
                <li>single recipe page</li>
                <li>help page</li>
            </ul>
            <p>I struggled a little bit with designing my home page because of the search and filter features. I wasn't
                sure if it was better to have them all on one page or a separate page, so I designed both to see how
                they would look
                like. In one option, I could have it all on one page for things to be easily accessible for users. In
                the other option, I could have the search and filters on a separate page so that the home page can be
                more focused on just browsing.</p>

            <img class="design" src="casestudy-images/filter.webp" alt="filter" width="1007" height="352">
            <p>For informing no results, I was also deciding between a pop up at the bottom of the screen or having
                another page pull up when that happens. The first one has the information at the bottom where product
                cards would show up if there are results. This design allows for consistency and creates a mental model
                for users. The second one has a clean and simplistic design without being noisy.</p>
            <img class="design" src="casestudy-images/noresults.webp" alt="no results" width="1112" height="402">
            <p>The other features weren't as hard to design as I wanted a simple, top down layout for it to be easy for
                users to read.</p>

            <h3>Style Guide</h3>
            <p>I needed a theme for my website. Taking the fact that this is related to food, I decided on
                "Hell's Paradise" as a play on words from Hell's Kitchen. I wanted a playful, humorous website with the
                word choices.
            </p>
            <p>To keep it hell themed, I blend red and black together with white to make sure there's enough
                contrast for visibility purposes. Since I have a gradient affect going on, I chose to create that affect
                with my product cards since there are generally bright. I had images take up the whole card because this
                is a recipe website, so food needs to be big and attracting for people to want it.</p>
            <img class="design" src="casestudy-images/product.webp" alt="product" width="1897" height="458">
            <p>For fonts, I wanted something bold and gothic. Jacques Francois Shadow is bold and stylized enough to be
                used as titles and headings, while Merriweather is great for descriptions while still keeping that same
                feeling.</p>

            <h3>Code/Development</h3>
            <p>In Alpha, I started off with coding HTML and CSS with placeholder text and images to flesh out the
                content, layout, style.</p>
            <p>I struggled a bit with the product card since some images had different sizes with varying
                lengths in their name. I had to make sure the name section had enough spacing around it to not feel too
                tight, but also so that it doesn't take over their respective image. I also had an issue where the
                images were stretched.</p>
            <div class="learn">
                <p>What I Learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>how to create placeholder website utilizing HTML and CSS</li>
                    <li>proportioned name to image</li>
                    <li>kept images unstretched for visual appeal</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>In Beta, I extracted the recipe data into a datasheet and imported it into a database for development. By
                replacing the placeholder text and images with PHP and mySQL, I was able to generate a fully functioning
                website that pulls in data from the database when needed.</p>
            <p>After getting recipes generated on the home page, I had a better understanding of how PHP and mySQL
                worked. During my testings with the site, I ran into problems with the search and filter. Because I
                tried to simplify the code to save storage space, they
                kept colliding with each other.</p>
            <div class="learn">
                <p>What I Learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>created commands with PHP and mySQL to have the website extract the necessary data when needed
                    </li>
                    <li>separated the two functions with if statements so they can flow better</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <p>In Final, I encountered compatibility issues because
                the server running on an older version of PHP and mySQL, the website ran into problems so I had to make
                sure that my code
                was flexible enough so that older servers could run them. I also added more images so that the single
                recipe page had more visuals.</p>
            <div class="learn">
                <p>What I Learned:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>diagnosed compatibility issues tied to older server versions</li>
                    <li>refactored code to maintain functionality</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <hr>
            <h2>The Solution</h2>
            <p>For my pages, I chose to have the home page just for browsing recipes and had the search and filters in a
                separate page. This way, users can focus on browsing and only go to the other page if need be.</p>
            <p>For informing no results, I chose to keep it in the same page for consistency and so that users wouldn't
                need to travel between pages often.</p>
            <p>Single recipe page also has images to help assist users in case they need visual feedback while cooking.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>The Results</h2>
            <p>In my 10 weeks, I ideated, designed, and developed my recipe website. I utilized PHP and mySQL to create
                a fully functional website. Through testing of the website on a public server, product cards were
                generated well on the home page and the corresponding data in the single recipe page were correct. I was
                also able to generate recipes from the search and filter, and it returned a notification when no results
                were found. Overall, I would say this project was a success.</p>
            <p>I learned a lot about coding with PHP and mySQL and extracting data for the database. In the future, I
                would make sure I have everything planned out, such as the data information, before executing anything
                to development.</p>
